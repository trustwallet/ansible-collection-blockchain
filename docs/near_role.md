# NEAR Role

Ansible role to manage NEAR blockchain node.

The role installs Rust to compile NEAR binary. The compilation takes very long, be patient.

## Role Variables

The role has default variables (see `defaults/main.yml`) which can be adjusted.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: "all"
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  
  roles:
    - role: trustwallet.blockchain.near
      data_dir: /mnt/data/.near # exampe of non-default data directory, default is /home/near/.near
      quicksync_mode: rpc # options are rpc, archive and none (sync from scratch)
```

## Development

To aid in the development and testing of the Ansible role, we are 
using [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) roles testing framework.

```shell
molecule -v test -s near
```
